Contains 3d models used to display the 3d file for the keyboard

https://github.com/infused-kim/kb_ergogen_fp/tree/main/3d_models is the source for:
Choc_V1_Keycap_MBK_White_1u
Choc_V1_Hotswap
Choc_V1_Switch
Nice_Nano_V2
And has others that may be useful (power buttons, pin headers, etc)

It also contaisn instructions with how to use them https://github.com/infused-kim/kb_ergogen_fp but i think nowadays its better to use celoides footprint parameters https://github.com/ceoloide/ergogen-footprints/blob/main/switch_choc_v1_v2.js

IMPORTANT, THE NICE NANO + the headers is still less tall than the switches, but not by much
