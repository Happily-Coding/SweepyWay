# How we create the palmrest and tenting
We create the palmrest and tenting using python, specifically a library call trimesh along with some custom code.

We create it from the dxf files that are the output of ergomesh outlines.

The reason we do this instead of using openjscad, is that I'm more familiar with python than javascript and trimesh and python seem to have better llm support than openjscad and javascript.
