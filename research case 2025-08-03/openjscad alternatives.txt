 Trimesh (Python)

✅ 1. Trimesh (Python)

    Mesh-level manipulation

    Fully inspectable, print vertices and faces as arrays

    Works well with DXF, STL, OBJ, and programmatic geometry

Example:

import trimesh

mesh = trimesh.load("l_hand_rest_polygon.dxf")  # works if the DXF is closed paths
print(mesh.vertices)
print(mesh.faces)

mesh.export("out.stl")

You can also build lofts using trimesh.creation.extrude_polygon() and custom slicing.



✅ 3. OpenCascade via PythonOCC

    The engine behind FreeCAD and CadQuery

    Lower-level and far more powerful

    You can extract vertices, faces, edges, points — all exactly like you’re describing

But: it’s complex and verbose, not ideal for fast prototyping.





5. FreeCAD + Python

    Great for inspecting everything

    Good for boolean modeling and parametric CAD

    You can run Python scripts in FreeCAD to control modeling
