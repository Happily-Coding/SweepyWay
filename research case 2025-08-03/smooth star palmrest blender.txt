You want the top surface of the shape to be:

    Flat along the Y direction (from front to back),

    But gently sloping downward along the X direction (left to right),

    With the curve defined like this:

y = height * cos(t * π / 2)

That means:

    At x = 0, height is maximum (cos(0) = 1),

    At x = width, height is 0 (cos(π/2) = 0),

    This creates a smooth downward curve, perfect for ergonomic shapes.
